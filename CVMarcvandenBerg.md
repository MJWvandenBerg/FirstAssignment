## curriculum vitae


#### Personal Profile

My name is Marc and I would describe myself as **social, flexible and eager to learn**. Due to my experience as an editor in chief I have learned to not be afraid in **being critical towards myself**. I am a good **team-player** and find it comforting to discuss with others as well as solve problems together with others. Through my internship at Center Parcs I have become more **assertive** and find it easier to ask questions. To conclude I would like to note I can easily adjust myself to my environment both inside as outside of the working environment.
